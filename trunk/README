Folder structure:
	doc folder: 	project report and notebook
	source folder: 	running scripts
	bin folder:	supporting programs
	results: 	inside each subfolder are SQLite database and logs for each running time.
	data: 		testing data


Project requirement:
	Python 2.7
	Biopython 1.6
	SQLite 3


Project environment:
	Unix


To remove noisy column from one MSA file, use this command:
	./reducenoise.py -in inputFile -out outputFile	
both inputFile and outputFile are Fasta format


To evaluate the constructed tree from denoised MSA files in a folder, use this command:
	./evaluate -dir folderName
this command will write all distances and corresponding file name to stdout


To stores the calculated distances, use this command:
	./updateSQL.py -in statisticInput -out sqliteFile
this script takes the output of the evaluate command as its input, all the distances will then be stored in SQLite database


To execute all above steps with all provided data use runall script inside source folder. This script will create a subfolder in side results folder that corresponded to the running time (format: yyyymmddhhmm)
